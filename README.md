# Stock-Price-Prediction-Using-Stacked-LSTM

I have tried to predict the Closing Stock Prices of Facebook for the next 30 days using this Stacked LSTM model. The idea of this project was developed by watching a Youtube project tutorial by Krish Naik.

## Data Collection
For the data collection part, I have used "pandas-datareader" library and using the api_key of "tiingo" (one can create this api_key by visiting the pandas-datareader web page and then from there to the tiingo web page, sign-up for tiingo and then visiting the Documentation part), I have extracted the last five years stock data for Facebook.
For the Legal reason and as for the terms and conditions of "tiingo", publishing of the data is restricted. So, I'm not storing the data here in the repository, besides one can easily get the data from the "tiingo" api.
